Vimya can be used to execute the contents of a Vim buffer (or the current visual selection) in Autodesk Maya. The plugin will save the commands to be executed in a temporary file and tell Maya via the command port to source this file. Both MEL and Python scripts are supported, Maya's log can optionally be opened in a separate tab in Vim (requires the Tail Bundle plugin vimscript #1714).

Important: You need a Vim version with built-in Python support to run this plugin!
